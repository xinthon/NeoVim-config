# NeoVim Configuration

This repository hosts a comprehensive NeoVim configuration setup tailored for developers who want a modern, efficient, and feature-rich coding environment. Built using Lua, this configuration enhances NeoVim by adding improved functionality, custom plugins, and optimized settings that cater to various programming needs.

## Features

- **Efficient Key Bindings**: Custom key mappings that make navigation and editing a breeze.
- **Plugin Management**: Leveraging `packer.nvim` for efficient plugin management.
- **Enhanced UI**: Improved user interface with themes, status bar, and tab configurations.
- **Language Support**: Extended support for multiple programming languages with syntax highlighting, LSP integration, and auto-completion.
- **Performance Tweaks**: Optimizations to make NeoVim faster and more responsive.

## Prerequisites

Before you install this configuration, ensure you have the following installed:
- NeoVim (0.5 or newer)
- Git
- A terminal that supports TrueColor

## Structure

- `init.lua`: The main entry file that loads all configurations.
- `lua/`: Directory containing all Lua configuration files.
  - `plugins.lua`: Plugin configurations and setups.
  - `settings.lua`: General settings for NeoVim.
  - `keymaps.lua`: Key mappings for better efficiency.
  - `theme.lua`: Theme settings and UI enhancements.

## Customization

You can customize your NeoVim setup by editing the Lua files in the `lua/` directory. Each file is modular, making it easy to update settings, keymaps, or plugins without affecting other aspects of the configuration.
